Unfortunately, events often have problems with particular attendees. If you want to know some common reasons you'll have trouble, you can read through the [CodeDay Rules](https://codeday.org/rules) and the [Code of Conduct](https://srnd.org/conduct).

That said, even if something isn't in the rules, you still have final say as to whether something is allowed or not. In addition to being in our payment policy, it's also in the rules:

> The organizers will interpret all event rules and the Code of Conduct in understanding of the spirit.
> 
> Organizers have the authority to disqualify you from any awards, remove you from the event, and have you banned from future events. If you're removed from the event, you will not receive a refund, and may need to call a parent to pick you up.
> 
> If you register for an event once you have been banned, you will not be allowed entry, and your ticket will not be refunded.

# Serious Offenses

The following offenses should almost always lead to immediate expulsion from the event:

- Any repeated harassing comments, or harassment which makes an attendee feel extremely uncomfortable, unsafe, or unwelcome
- Use of a knife in a threatening way
- Presence of a gun
- Theft
- Consumption of drugs or alcohol on-premises (excluding medical use and tobacco)
- Any conduct or rules offense from an older student or a volunteer/mentor/etc

If any event of this level comes up, please let your StudentRND contact know.

## Less-Serious Offenses

In some cases, you may want to issue a warning. Warnings should generally only be issued to high school students, who still have developing social and decision-making skills, and who can be influenced to behave reasonably.

Here are some common less-serious offenses, although anything which isn't in the serious offenses list is a candidate. Warnings should only be given for a first offense; further offenses should lead to expulsion.

- One-time comment which disparages a group, but which isn't directed or heard by a student of that group (non-targeted)
- "Showing off" that an attendee has a knife, but to impress rather than threaten
- "Hitting on" another attendee, even if that attendee seems responsive
- Visible presence of drugs or alcohol, if the attendee is of legal age.
- "Messing with" another student's project or computer when the student isn't there
- Being generally disruptive

# Dealing with Violations

In general, Code Evangelists, and not event staff, should be the only ones to talk to attendees and parents regarding an offense. If someone else sees a violation, they should let the Code Evangelist know the details, and should not otherwise be present during a discussion with the attendee (except in cases where life is in danger).

Make your decision about how you will proceed before talking with an attendee. If an attendee is rude to you, it's ok to impose a more severe punishment (e.g. a disruptive attendee receives an expulsion rather than a warning because they're flippant in the discussion) but you should not allow the possibility of being "talked down" to a warning.

In any dangerous situation, you should call the police and, if you feel it's safe, attempt to deescalate the situation until they arrive.

If you're at all uncertain of the facts, keep a close eye on the participant. If the complaint involves a weapon, drugs, alcohol, or theft, our rules allow staff to search backpacks and other belongings.

## Be Fair

It's important that your determinations are fair and applied equally. If you have any questions about what you should do, call your StudentRND contact before acting.

For an example of how this can go wrong, a staff member once expelled a female participant for "hooking up with" a male participant, while the male participant was not punished. (This is also another example of why staff should not communicate with participants about rule violations if possible.)

## Talking to Participants

When you talk with an attendee, make it clear that this is not a court proceeding: your decision has already been made, and you are there to inform them of the decision, not discuss the facts or the punishment. (If you're giving a warning, you can be a little nicer in your phrasing: "I don't care whether it happened or not; we've had a complaint so I'm letting you know right now that it isn't acceptable.")

When expelling an attendee under 18, you should call their parents, who should be available to pick their student up per the terms of the permission slip and waiver they signed. Attendees over 18, or attendees who aren't able to reach a parent may leave on their own. You should not force an attendee to leave the building before a ride arrives, but you should remove them from the main area and have someone watch them.

Because bans are checked only by email, it's important that you let the student know if they will be banned, otherwise they may register with a different email in the future and not know about the ban until they're turned away at the door.
