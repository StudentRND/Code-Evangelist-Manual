Being inclusive isn't too complicated: it's about understanding alternatives.

We see very strong messages about what's normal each day: in advertisements, movies, and TV, but also in the communities we live in. When we only see a certain type of person or behavior, it's sometimes easy and natural to assume that it should be true of all people, and those who are different aren't "right."

In learning to be inclusive, we're asking you to unlearn these assumptions. That's tricky because we've been taught what's normal for a _long_ time, and sometimes there's only one person showing us an alternative.

We're going to spend some time understanding some common ways people choose to describe their sex, gender identity, and sexuality. Our goal is to expand our conception of what's "normal" by becoming more aware of different ways people live, to talk about the experience of having a stigmatized\/marginalized identity, and to learn about how to advocate for and support those with particular identities.

Later, we'll also discuss some common physical and mental disabilities.

Something you should know before you go on: nothing in this section is _the way it is_. Everyone's definitions, identity, and experiences are unique, so this is only a jumping-off point. The best way to learn about a person is to talk to that person -- which is already part of your job.

# Biases

Let's talk a little about biases. TK

# Privileges

Many people reading this section will be in the majority demographic in most important ways. From the position, it can often be difficult to see how those characteristics can dramatically affect others' interactions with the world.

Take a few minutes to read through this very small selection of privlidges you might have. If you could only retain a few of these privlidges, which would you choose? Which would you give up?

* Being able to create video game characters which look like you.
* Finding role models and mentors of the same gender as you.
* Being referred to with pronouns which match your gender.
* Knowing that your ideas are being heard, and listeners aren't just hoping for a date.
* Using public bathrooms without fear of being harassed.
* Being affectionate with a partner in public without threat.
* Freely being able to discuss your relationship with others.
* Having others comfort you when a relationship ends.
* Having your partner accepted by your family.
* Making new friends without fear that they'll cut contact when they get to know you.

Most of these samples had to do with sex and gender identity, but there are many other important factors which might lead to privlidges. Take a moment and consider what might have been unavailable or more difficult if not for:

* Your ethnicity
* Where you live
* Your income, and your family's income growing up
* Your physical \(and mental\) abilities
