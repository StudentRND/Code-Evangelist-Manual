So you've made it through the whole guide, and you're confident you know what it takes to be an effective Code
Evangelist?

Your next step is to take the [review exam.](https://srnd.wufoo.com/forms/code-evangelist-training-review/) This exam
will help us understand how we can best help you prepare for your job. There's no failing score, so please don't
reference this manual.

(Don't know the password? You didn't read this manual closely enough ;))

# Shadowing

If possible, we will assign you to shadow an existing Code Evangelist at one of our events.  During a shadow, you'll
have the opportunity to watch and practice:

- Creating the culture:
  - Being friendly and enthusiastic
  - Running an activity
- Supporting students:
  - Gathering insights from community members
  - Guiding technical questions
- Leading conversations and answering questions

You can expect feedback after you practice, but it's more "training" and less "evaluation."

# Running an Event

This training covers how to be effective as a Code Evangelist. If you're running SRND events, you should also
familiarize yourself with those event formats (particularly if you're running a smaller event, where you might not have
volunteers to help with logistics.)

# After-Event Feedback

Once you lead your first event, you might wonder: how can I tell how I'm doing?
