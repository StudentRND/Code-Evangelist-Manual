So you've made it through the whole guide, and you're confident you know what it takes to be an effective Code
Evangelist?

Your next step is to take the [review exam.](https://srnd.wufoo.com/forms/code-evangelist-training-review/) This exam
will help us understand how we can best help you prepare for your job. There's no failing score, so please don't
reference this manual.

(Don't know the password? You didn't read this manual closely enough ;))

# Shadowing

If possible, we will assign you to shadow an existing Code Evangelist at one of our events.  During a shadow, you'll
have the opportunity to watch and practice:

- Creating the culture:
  - Being friendly and enthusiastic
  - Running an activity
- Supporting students:
  - Gathering insights from community members
  - Guiding technical questions
- Leading conversations and answering questions

You can expect feedback after you practice, but it's more "training" and less "evaluation."

# After-Event Feedback

After the end of an assigned event, we'll do our best to provide you with specific feedback.

Because no one in a supervisory role will be at the event (except if you're shadowing another Code Evangelist), this
feedback comes from student/volunteer survey responses, and these are often... not that detailed. You're encouraged,
then, to talk to students as they leave the event to try to get more specific feedback.
