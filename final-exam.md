So you've made it through the whole guide, and you're confident you know what it takes to be an effective Code
Evangelist?

Your next step is to take the [review exam.](https://srnd.wufoo.com/forms/code-evangelist-training-review/) This exam
will help us understand how we can best help you prepare for your job. There's no failing score, so please don't
reference this manual.

(Don't know the password? You didn't read this manual closely enough ;))

# Shadowing

If possible, we will assign you to shadow an existing Code Evangelist before your first event on your own. During your
shadow, you'll have the opportunity to watch and practice:

- Enthusiasm, and embracing the awkwardness
- Gathering attendee insights and building connections
- Leading conversations and answering questions

You can expect feedback after you practice, but it's more "training" and less "evaluation."

# After-Event Feedback

Once you lead your first event, you might wonder: how can I tell how I'm doing?
