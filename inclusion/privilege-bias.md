Many people reading this section will be in the majority demographic in most important ways. From the position, it can
often be difficult to see how those characteristics can dramatically affect others' interactions with the world.

Take a few minutes to read through this very small selection of privileges you might have. If you could only retain a
few of these privileges, which would you choose? Which would you give up?

* Being able to create video game characters which look like you.
* Finding role models and mentors of the same gender as you.
* Being referred to with pronouns which match your gender.
* Knowing that your ideas are being heard, and listeners aren't just hoping for a date.
* Using public bathrooms without fear of being harassed.
* Being affectionate with a partner in public without threat.
* Freely being able to discuss your relationship with others.
* Having others comfort you when a relationship ends.
* Having your partner accepted by your family.
* Making new friends without fear that they'll cut contact when they get to know you.

Most of these samples had to do with sex and gender identity, but there are many other important factors which might
lead to privileges. Take a moment and consider what might have been unavailable or more difficult if not for:

* Your ethnicity
* Where you live
* Your income, and your family's income growing up
* Your physical \(and mental\) abilities
