Many people reading this section will be in the majority demographic in most important ways. From the position, it can
often be difficult to see how those characteristics can dramatically affect others' interactions with the world.

A privilege is benefiting from an unearned advantage. Sometimes this is a big advantage, but oftentimes it's something
small which "adds up" over time. (For example, if you're a white person, you're unlikely to be asked "what white
people think about this game.")

Because we often meet community members who have different backgrounds from us, looking at our difference in privileges
is a helpful way to understand how they may see the world, which helps us relate better, find more relevant ways to
overcome barriers to learning CS, and be more effective in increasing CS enrollment.

# Examples

Take a few minutes to read through this very small selection of privileges you might have. If you could only retain a
few of these privileges, which would you choose?

* Being able to play video game characters which look like you.
* Finding role models and mentors of the same gender as you.
* Being referred to with pronouns which match your gender.
* Knowing that your ideas are being heard, and listeners aren't just hoping for a date.
* Using public bathrooms without fear of being harassed.
* Being affectionate with a partner in public without threat.
* Freely being able to discuss your relationship with others.
* Having your partner accepted by your family.
* Making new friends without fear that they'll cut contact when they get to know you.

Most of these samples had to do with sex and gender identity, but there are many other important factors which might
lead to privileges. Take a moment and consider what might have been unavailable or more difficult if not for:

* Your ethnicity
* Where you live
* Your income, and your family's income growing up
* Your physical \(and mental\) abilities
