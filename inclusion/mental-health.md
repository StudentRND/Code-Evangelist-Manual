The terms "mental health" and "emotional disorders" refer to disorders that affect how people think and feel. Although
they aren't as tangible, they're every bit as real as physical disorders. It's important that we make an effort to
support and include people who may be suffering from one.

Remember that we are not doctors or therapists. If you are concerned for the immediate health or safety, call 911.
(For less-immediate concerns, call their emergency contacts.)

# Common Issues You May See

- **ADHD:** Community members suffering from ADHD often have poor impulse control, trouble focusing their attention,
  and become easily frustrated. They may also have trouble keeping still or being quiet when necessary.
- **Social Competency and Processing Issues:** Many community members have difficulty understanding and responding to
  "normal" social expectations. They may not understand the reactions and emotions of other people and seem
  self-absorbed.
- **Anxiety:** Those suffering from anxiety can appear nervous, stressed, or agitated, and may be impatient, easily
  frustrated, or quick to anger. Those suffering from OCD may seem more extreme, and also have behavioral compulsions.
  Some community members may also suffer from panic attacks, an intense, physiological manifestation which includes
  sweating, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
- **Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and other Mood Disorders:** Community members who suffer from mood disorders can
  react in ways that seem disproportionate and unreasonable. They often appear to take things overly personally, and
  may act angry or withdrawn (depression) or agitated or elevated (bipolar).
- **Inappropriate Sexual Behavior:** Sometimes, community members who suffer from any of the above conditions may act
  in ways which creates discomfort for other community members. Sexual harassment (or sexual behavior of any kind)
  cannot be tolerated as part of our events, even if it may be the result of an emotional disorder.

Please remember that we are not trying to diagnose students with conditions, nor should we ask students for information
about their health (unless it's volunteered). Our goal is only to understand why some people may not be able to behave
"normally" so we can better support them.

# Exciting Events Are Sometimes Too Exciting

Many things which make events exciting for us can be detrimental to those prone to suffering from emotional disorders.

- **Crowded** workspaces may trigger anxiety or panic attacks, or worsen irrational behavior.
- **Excitement** from high-energy and hyper-social events can worsen bad behavior in those with trouble controlling
  impulses or considering consequences.
- **Deadlines** like judging can heighten emotions anxiety or stress. Community members may ignore basic needs like
  eating, drinking, and hygene.
- **Competition** (either at the main event, or during activities) can increase aggression and raise the chances of
  inappropriate behavior. Losing can worsen irrational behavior.
- **Noise or visual stimulation** can, at times, be too much for students to cope with.

# How We Can Help

Remember, we are not doctors or therapists. In most cases, no actions we take will directly improve the mental health
of our community members, however we can be compassionate, and offer our support to students who request it, or who
are showing extreme behaviors:

- Simply listening and being supportive of students' needs can be helpful. Make it clear that they are not being a
  "burden."
- Contacting family members or friends may make it easier for students to cope. No need to be pushy, but reminding them
  they have someone they can call and offering your phone may be helpful.
- Encourage students to take a break in a quiet location, with a staff member if helpful.

Despite making our best effort to be compassionate, inappropriate behavior which violates our conduct standards can
impact the ability of others to safely enjoy the event, and should still be treated as a behavior problem. In most
cases, students respond well to disciplinary counseling for small violations, but repeated or larger violations should
be escalated as normal.
