For the last few years, "inclusion" has been a large goal for many in the technology industry, and we think that's
great! However, it's also become a buzzword for of us: we say we need to be inclusive without thinking about what it
means or how to achieve it.

# What Is Inclusion?

Let's start with this example: if CodeDay is inclusive, why don't we allow...

* ...non-students? \(We're excluding adults who want to learn to code.\)
* ...alcohol or drugs? \(We're possibly excluding people with substance abuse problems.\)
* ...sexual behavior? \(We're possibly excluding people with certain mental disorders.\)
* ...students who want to create exclusive cultures? \(We're excluding GamerGate.\)

Reddit would take this as proof that inclusion is flawed, but we think it shows a misunderstanding of inclusivity.

Few spaces are targeted at everyone, and that's ok; there are endless important reasons to exclude some groups from
participating in some things. However, we sometimes exclude groups unintentionally \(or worse, out of ignorance or
prejudice\).

In talking about inclusion, we're talking about purposefully doing things to make people feel that they are part of our
community, and not doing things which make them feel separate.

# Why is inclusion important?

Practically: when participants feel normal and validated, they're way more likely to take risks and try new things,
both of which are necessary for beginners to get interested in technology.

More importantly, we think it's the right thing to do. We've all felt like we don't belong at times, and it sucks. Our
community is pretty cool, and we'd like to let as many people join as we can.

# How do we become inclusive?

We see very strong messages about what's normal each day: in advertisements, movies, and TV, but also in the communities
we live in. When we only see a certain type of person or behavior, it's sometimes easy and natural to assume that it
should be true of all people, and those who are different aren't "right."

In learning to be inclusive, we're asking you to unlearn these assumptions. That's tricky because we've been taught
what's normal for a _long_ time, and sometimes there's only one person showing us an alternative. Our goal is to expand
our conception of what's "normal," and understand how to support people who aren't like us.

To do that, we'll spend some time exploring common ways people feel about their sex, gender identity, and sexuality.
Later, we'll also discuss some common physical and mental disabilities.

Something you should know before you go on: nothing in this section is _the way it is_. Everyone's definitions, identity,
and experiences are unique, so this is only a jumping-off point. The best way to learn about a person is to talk to that
person -- which is already part of your job.
