# What \(Not\) to Say

People will ask you a lot of questions at CodeDay.

Remember, the goal of the event is to ensure that people know enough to keep going after. There's no way you'll be able to teach them all of programming in the event \(or in any finite period of time at all, for that matter\).

Instead, your goal is to teach them how to learn.

To this end, answering a question directly is counterproductive. As frustrating as it may be, you should almost never answer a question unless:

* It's a "find the button" question
* They've been banging their heads for a long time, despite your attempts to help

Instead of answering questions directly, try to ask pointed questions, and help them figure out the correct questions to ask. Some questions which generally work well:

* What have you searched for?
* Where do you think the bug might be in your code?
* Tell me how your code works.
* What have you tried?

\(Often, helping them take their mind off the problem with an activity works well, too.\)

# "Learning" Programming and "Experts"

A good indication that you're doing something wrong: if a group keeps asking you questions every few minutes.

Many students subconsciously believe in the idea of a universal programming expert; that, after working in the industry for some number of years, you become an endless repository of knowledge. They probably think you're one of those people.

Beginner programmers tend to be the most affected by this because they have basic questions, “how do I add files in Git?”, which people who’ve been programming for more than a month have dealt with hundreds of times. Most programmers know Git, but even the best of us struggle with Linux kernel development. 

By answering questions directly, you're re-enforcing the idea that:

* you're a "programming expert", and
* they're not, and they need to study and work hard to become one, and so
* they can't really participate without your help.

That's why it's so, so, so important that you help with problem-solving and Googling skills, rather than answering questions: you risk students leaving _less_ empowered.
