If you ask a room of 100 random high school students what they think "coding" looks like most will either describe
being forced to take a class by a parent or their school, and maybe a quarter will describe this:

If you ask a few hundred random high school students what they think about "coding," most will either describe their bad
experience from being forced to take a Java class or, well, this:

Surrounded by a certain demographic of friend group, it's sometimes hard to believe, but most students do not want to
learn to code. The traditional approach of increasing CS participation -- more classes and workshops -- leaves these
students out because they don't want to enroll. They think they hate coding.

As Code Evangelists, our goal is to find sneaky ways to slowly change their minds.

Events like CodeDay attract students with only tangential interests -- often students who want to make art or music
for games. Our job is to get to know these students, find out what excites them, and help them use code in a way that
furthers those existing interests. To be successful, we also need to remove some barriers, making sure they feel
comfortable and have a fun time.

# Expectations

- **Be unreasonably friendly and enthusiastic.** The community matches the enthusiasm of the person in charge.
- **Get to know each student.** Have authentic communications which help you learn about what excites each student.
- **Be purposeful and practive.** Approach shy students. Keep an eye out for sketchy situations.
- **When you're working, give the community your full attention.** Stow your laptop and your phone, you won't need them.
- **Stay healthy.** Schedule breaks, get enough sleep, and eat well.

# Anti-Expectations

- **We do not teach.** Teachers write learning objectives for students. Code Evangelists help the students discover
their own personal interests.
- **We do not "run events."** Yes, if there's no one else available to help, you might need to sign for a food delivery,
but your role is not to run logistics.
