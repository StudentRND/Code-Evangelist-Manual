Like many things, there's a power law distribution when it comes to getting students excited about technology: a small number of people make a huge difference in a large number of students' lives. When we started CodeDay, we decided to call these people Code Evangelists, because they go out into the world to spread a love of code.

# Evangelism Isn't Teaching

Notice what wasn't mentioned above: teaching. That's because _**the job of a Code Evangelist isn't to teach coding. **_Many programs already fill that gap, but most students still aren't interested in learning.

_**Code Evangelism is about inspiring students to want to code.**_

We believe that, when students are excited about coding, they'll figure out the _how_ on their own. Many of us followed that exact path; maybe that's even how you got into coding?

# A Formula for Falling In Love

You might have seen us describe this process as "inspiring students to fall in love with coding." In a practical sense, though, how can we inspire students to fall in love with anything?

For many students, we can't: coding isn't for everyone. A majority of students, however, have unrealistic expectations of coding, and it's often as simple as showing them it's not what they thought. \(Many students, when asked, will still describe coding as typing 1s and 0s!\)

To have the highest chance of convincing students to fall in love with coding, we need to:

1. Get them to try it:
  1. Sneak around existing misconceptions.
  2. Create a friendly and supportive atmosphere to encourage exploration.

2. Make it a positive experience:
  1. Identify frustrated\/overwhelmed students, and provide \(some\) help.
  2. Keep things fun externally to code.

3. Keep them going:
  1. Empower students to solve their own problems.
  2. Foster a broader student tech community.
