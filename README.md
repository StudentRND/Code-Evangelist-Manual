Like many things, there's a power law distribution when it comes to getting students excited about technology: a small
number of people make a huge difference in a large number of students' lives. We decided to call these people Code
Evangelists, because they encourage a love of code.

# Code EvangelistÂ®

Code Evangelist is a registered trademark of SRND because we want to make sure the term is a mark of quality. You can
use your skills at any code-related event, not just CodeDay, but first you need to complete our free training course.
