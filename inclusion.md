For the last few years, "inclusion" has been a large goal for many in the technology industry, and we think that's great! However, it's also become a buzzword for many of us: we say we need to be inclusive without thinking about what it means or how to achieve it.

So before we talk about how to be inclusive, let's start by talking about what that means, why it's important. Then, in the following sections, we'll look at how we can create an inclusive atmosphere.

# What Is Inclusion?

Let's start with this example: if CodeDay is inclusive, why don't we allow...

* ...non-students? \(We're excluding adults who want to learn to code.\)
* ...alcohol or drugs? \(We're possibly excluding people with substance abuse problems.\)
* ...sexual behavior? \(We're possibly excluding people with certain mental disorders.\)
* ...students who want to create exclusive cultures? \(We're excluding GamerGate.\)

Certain internet groups would take this as proof that inclusion is flawed, but we think it shows a misunderstanding of inclusivity.

Few spaces are targeted at everyone, and that's ok; there are endless important reasons to exclude some groups from participating in some things. However, we sometimes exclude groups unintentionally \(or worse, intentionally out of ignorance\).

In talking about inclusion, we're talking about purposefully doing things to make people feel that they are part of our community, and not doing things which make them feel separate.

# Why Is Inclusion Important?

Here's a practical argument: when participants feel normal and validated, they're way more likely to take risks and try new things, both of which are necessary for beginners to get interested in technology.

Really, though, being inclusive is something that we want to do because it's the right thing to do. Most everyone wants a feeling of "belongingness" and dreads a feeling of being an outsider; being intentionally inclusive increases the chance that someone will find a place in our community.

It's _particularly_ important for you because our community looks up to Code Evangelists, so modeling good inclusive behavior makes the community more inclusive as a whole.
