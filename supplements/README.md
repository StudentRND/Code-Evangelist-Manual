This training covers how to be effective as a Code Evangelist. If you're running SRND events, you should also
familiarize yourself with those event formats (particularly if you're running a smaller event, where you might not have
volunteers to help with logistics.)

It's important to remember that you should almost always be doing _something._ Except at very small events, there's
usually someone feeling just a little sad, stressed out, or overly introverted who you can be helping.

These supplements serve as cheat-sheets for what you, as a Code Evangelist, should do at each event.
