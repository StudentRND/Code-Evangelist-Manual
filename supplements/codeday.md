If you're the Code Evangelist at a larger event, you should probably be specifically focusing on the job, and not
event-specific responsibilities, which will be handled by volunteers.

If you're at a smaller event, you'll also need to do some event-specific tasks. Make sure to read through the
[CodeDay Event Training](https://codeday.training.srnd.org/) which covers things this guide won't, such as how to
check students in, and the content of workshops.

# Hour-by-Hour
## The Early-Event

- **11:00am:** Greet students and gather insights at check-in.
- **11:45am:** Icebreaker.
- **12:00pm:** [Kickoff presentation!](https://clear.codeday.org/dayof/deck/slides)
- **12:30pm:** Encourage everyone to pitch, and kick it off with some silly ideas of your own.
- **1:00pm:** Lunch, and the intro workshop (if you're teaching it).
- **Until 5pm:** Flex time
  - Patrol the venue and gather insights.
  - Light activity (e.g. slideshare improv).
  - Good time for a break.

## The Mid-Event
- **6:00pm:** Dinner! Encourage socializing by forcing students to leave their computers and eat in the dinner area.
- **7:00pm-12:00am:** Flex time
  - Continue to patrol, checking in with as many students as possible. Focus students who don't seem to be integrating
    with the culture, are stressed, or otherwise unhappy.
  - CodeCup is at 7PT/10ET. Get students ready for it at least 15min early.
  - High-energy activity (e.g. karaoke or walk).
  - Take a break.
  - 11pm is a good time for a shift-change so someone can sleep.

## The Late Event
- **12:00am:** Midnight snack: encourage students to meet others by forcing them to leave their computers. Consider
  this an "ice cream social."
- **1am-4am:** Flex time
  - Patrol, focus frustrated students and encourage them to take a break.
  - 4am is a good time for shift change.
- **5am-7am:** Help groups cut features to get to a demo-able project.

## The End-Game
- **8am-9am:** Convince as many groups to present as you can. Find a way for them to present _something_ even if it's
  not what they wanted.
- **9am-10am:** Introduce judges to students.
- **10am-11am:** MC presentations
- **11am-12pm:** Help judges decide on awards based on the CodeDay culture criteria (creativity, effort, polish)

# Shifts

A key expectation of an Evangelist is taking care of yourself. Take regular breaks during flex time (do this outside of
view of the attendees to avoid getting bothered, but do not leave the venue unless there's someone else assigned to
supervise).

If there's another Code Evangelist assigned, you should trade off two shifts: 11pm-4am, and 4am-9am. Ask your
replacement to wake you up, and set two alarms for 15 and 30 minutes later as backups. (Make sure your phone has
sufficient battery or is plugged in.) It is extremely important that someone is always awake.

If you only have volunteers, you can choose one to run the event while you sleep, but you **must** sleep during the
first window (which requires fewer Evangelist skills), and you must brief them on:

- How to encourage socialization during the midnight snack
- How to answer technical questions
- Emergency procedure: wake you up (or call 911) if anything happens

# Judges

If you don't go in with the judges, they will generally make really bad decisions. Judges should only judge teams on:

- Creativity
- Effort
- Polish

You are not a neutral observer. You should guide the conversation, provide information on teams (this is important in
helping judges evaluate effort), and help them make a quick decision.

When you're done, assign each award to a specific judge, and have them present their rationale for giving out the award.
