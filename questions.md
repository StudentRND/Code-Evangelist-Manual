**We do not answer technical questions.** That's a little over-broad for a student coding event, but it's more true
than you might first think.

People ask us a lot of questions at CodeDay.

Remember, our job is to encourage students to pursue coding. We won't always be around, so it's important that we teach
them how to learn, not just explain everything ourselves.

Instead of answering questions directly, try to ask pointed questions, and help them figure out the correct questions
to ask. Some questions which generally work well:

* What have you searched for?
* Where do you think the bug might be in your code?
* Tell me how your code works.
* What have you tried?

(Often, helping them take their mind off the problem with an activity works well, too.)

# "Learning" Programming and "Experts"

A good indication that you're doing something wrong: if a group keeps asking you questions every few minutes.

Many students subconsciously believe in the idea of a universal programming expert; that, after working in the industry
for some number of years, you become an endless repository of knowledge. They probably think you're one of those people.

Beginner programmers tend to be the most affected by this because they have basic questions, “how do I add files in
Git?”, which people who’ve been programming for more than a month have dealt with hundreds of times. Most programmers
know Git, but even the best of us struggle with Linux kernel development. 

By answering questions directly, you're re-enforcing the idea that:

* you're a "programming expert", and
* they're not, and they need to study and work hard to become one, and so
* they can't really participate without your help.

That's why it's so, so, so important that you help with problem-solving and Googling skills, rather than answering
questions: you risk students leaving _less_ empowered.

# The Exception

Ok, so sometimes we do have to answer questions. The two usual reasons are:

* It's a "find the button" question.
* They've been banging their heads for a 5-10 minutes, despite your attempts to help.

# When to Help

Early in the event, students may not feel comfortable enough approaching us to ask for help. This improves as we build
connections with each individual, but sometimes extra vigilance is warranted.

While we're patrolling, we can keep an eye out for signs of stalled progress -- such as browsing reddit, playing video
games, or staring blankly at the screen -- and for stress markers -- like biting their nails or messing with hair.

Being stuck or stressed occasionally is ok, but it's important to intervene if it goes on for a while.
