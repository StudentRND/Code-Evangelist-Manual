As we've discussed a number of times, most students don't want to learn to code to further their education -- if they do learn to code, it's usually because they think it's _fun._

Or, some of it is fun. As most professionals have learned, there really isn't such a thing as "coding," there's just "debugging" and "bugging." And debugging isn't really fun. For most of us, our morale with programming looks a bit like:



This is a big problem for beginners, however, who have an often wildly-inaccurate mental picture of how the computer is executing their code, and spend a huge amount of time trying to implement simple features. Without real progress to provide benefits, here's a graph of beginner morale over time:



Eventually morale gets low enough that they reach a "f\*ck it!" point, and they pack up and leave.

Classes and 1-1 mentoring can help a bit, but too much becomes "learning," and learning is boring. How do we solve this? Activities!

Large-group activities allow attendees to take their mind off their problems for a bit. This has the

effect of increasing their happiness, and increasing the probability of actually solving their problem.

You can create your own activities, but here are some we've found to be fun:

* 2am jog
* picture drawing contests
* mini programming contests
* karaoke
* dancing
* large group sing-alongs \("I'll Make a Man Out of You"\)
* group outings (see related subsection for safety concerns)

Activities should be used sparingly \(aim for exactly two activities\), and only briefly \(no more than 15-20 minutes on any one activity\).

If you're noticing a morale drop between activities, you can also do more frequent minor activities,

such as walking around offering people snacks, soda, and swag.
