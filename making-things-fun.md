As we've discussed a number of times, most students don't want to learn to code to further their education -- if they do learn to code, it's usually because they think it's _fun._

Or, some of it is fun. As most professionals have learned, there really isn't such a thing as "coding," there's just "debugging" and "bugging." And debugging isn't really fun. For most of us, our morale with programming looks a bit like:

This is a big problem for beginners, however, who have an often wildly-inaccurate mental picture of how the computer is executing their code, and spend a huge amount of time trying to implement simple features. Without real progress to provide benefits, here's a graph of beginner morale over time:

Eventually morale gets low enough that they reach a "f\*ck it!" point, and they pack up and leave.

Classes and 1-1 mentoring can help a bit, but too much becomes "learning," and learning is boring. How do we solve this? Activities!

# Activities

Activities allow attendees to take their mind off their problems for a bit. This has the effect of increasing their happiness, and increasing the probability of actually solving their problem.

You can create your own activities, but here are some we've found to be fun:

* 2am jog
* picture drawing contests
* mini programming contests
* karaoke
* dancing
* large group sing-alongs \("I'll Make a Man Out of You"\)
* group outings \(see related subsection for safety concerns\)

Activities should be used sparingly, and should be kept brief: 15-20 minutes for something which might distract non-participants \(like karaoke in the same room as coding\), or an hour for those which only pull people away from their team \(like an outing\).

## Ice Cream

Pretend I ask you, "do you want ice cream?" Almost all reasonable people will say yes. Yet thousands of ice cream shops go out of business in the US each year. That's because what people say they want and what people actually want are very different.

**Asking about activities is similar to asking about ice cream. Participants will say one thing \("I don't want to do this activity"\) but behave differently \(be more motivated after participating in an activity\).**

It's usually difficult to get attendees to participate in activities, but it's worth the effort spent convincing them. Evangelists who get attendees to participate in activities build up the community and increase morale; evangelists who don't actually decrease beginners' self-confidence.

# When to Help

How do you figure out if this is necessary? Patrol the event constantly, looking for signs such as browsing reddit or playing video games, staring blankly at the screen, or physical stress markers \(biting nails, messing with hair, and so on\).

This is okay once-and-a-while, but if someone is stressed for a long time, you should intervene.

If it's only one person, you should talk to them directly. Ask if they need help, or ask them for help with an activity which would take their mind off the problem for a while.

If you see a few people, you can also do a minor activity, such as walking around offering people snacks, soda, and swag.

Most often, though, stressed attendees come in waves, and seeing some stressed attendees might be a sign that it's a good time for a group activity.
