Have you ever watched a technical talk and thought, "this is absolute gibberish?" It often is, but with this activity, it's all but guaranteed. Here's how it works:

1. One or two "presenters" stand in front of a projection screen \(or TV\), facing the audience. They shouldn't be able to see what's on the screen behind them.
2. Open one of the many online slide deck repositories on the projector, and pick a random category.
3. Slowly hover your mouse over the available slide decks. The audience should cheer for the decks they think would be most funny.
4. Open the best deck, and give the presenters a clicker \(or mouse, or whatever else you have to advance the slides\).
5. After a count-down, the presenters should turn around to see their slide deck, and then immediately start trying to present.  Start a timer for three minutes.
