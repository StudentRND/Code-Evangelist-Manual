It's important to remember that you should almost always be doing _something._ Except at very small events, there's usually someone feeling just a little sad, stressed out, or overly introverted who you can be helping.

Because you should be busy, the only thing you'll need to use your laptop for the entire event is the early event: you can access check-in and the kickoff slides on the Day-Of page on Clear. Otherwise, leave it in your backpack.

You'll also notice that this is not a "pull" job -- students will not come to you with their problems. (They might ask for help with big, code-related problems, but that's not really your job.) Don't set up a station, you should be patrolling the venue, looking for people who need help.

If you're the Code Evangelist at a larger event, you should probably be specifically focusing on the job, and not event-specific responsibilities. If you're at a smaller event, you'll also need to do some event-specific tasks, which you'll be trained for separately.

Either way, as a Code Evangelist, you can use the following as a cheat-sheet of what your number-one priority should be throughout the event:

# Hour-by-Hour

## The Early-Event

- **11am-noon:** [Check-in!](https://clear.codeday.org/dayof) Focus on first-impressions. Make sure students know to be friendly, to meet new people, and to not be competitive with events and by meeting people and asking questions.
- **Noon:** [Kickoff!](https://clear.codeday.org/dayof/deck/slides) Make sure existing teams pitch their ideas and recruit new members, and that shy students speak up (pitch silly ideas). 
- **1-2pmish:** Lunch! Also the [Intro Workshop](https://blog.srnd.org/jumping-over-chairs-and-learning-to-make-a-game-with-construct-2-a796f4def9e9)
- **Until 5pm:** Patrol the venue, talk with groups, and troubleshoot culture problems.

## The Mid-Event

- **5pm:** [Splunk Workshop](https://blog.srnd.org/making-better-games-with-splunk-975cd2a605ce)
- **6pm:** Dinner! Encourage students to meet others by forcing them to leave their computers and eat in the dinner area.
- **7pm-Midnight:** Continue to patrol, checking in with as many students as possible. Identify students who don't seem integrated in the CodeDay culture, and talk with them, or make a note for future activities. Run an activity at some point in this period.

## The Late Event

- **Midnight:** Midnight snack: encourage students to meet others by forcing them to leave their computers. Consider this an "ice cream social."
- **1am-3am:** Patrol, looking for frustrated students. Encourage them to take a break. Run an event at some point, before people are getting too tired. Group activities work better than isolated ones at this time (such as a sing-along).
- **4am-7am:** Patrol, looking for frustrated students, and encouraging them to find a way to stop working on that problem. The odds of the student solving their problem while tired this close to the end of the event are small.

## The End-Game

- **8am:** Breakfast! Start presentation signups. Patrol, looking for teams who seem frustrated, or who haven't signed up, and figure out a way for them to present _something_.
- **9am:** As the judges arrive, explain judging, and give them a judging sheet. In your free time, continue to help teams who are behind so they'll have something to present. Not presenting is the worst outcome for long-term outcomes.
- **10am:** Start presentations. Announce on-deck, and time groups. Time per group should be `60 minutes/number of teams`.
- **11am:** Encourage teams to clean up/pack up. Go with judges, and encourage them to make reasonable choices. Provide feedback about which teams pushed themselves, which were friendly, etc.
- **Noon:** Announce awards (in order of: best game, best app, top overall, special awards). Thank everyone for coming, and briefly describe how they can keep going in their daily life.

# Working with Multiple Evangelists or Staff

When you have multiple Code Evangelists, you should schedule shifts so you have a chance to take a break and, at night, sleep! Make sure as many Code Evangelists as possible are working during busy periods: pre-kickoff, 1-3pm, and dinner.

You can delegate some tasks to non Evangelist-staff, but avoid delegating tasks which require specialized training as much as possible. For example, having staff round-up people for dinner is a good idea, but having them patrolling looking for culture issues is bad.
