If you're the Code Evangelist at a larger event, you should probably be specifically focusing on the job, and not event-specific responsibilities. If you're at a smaller event, you'll also need to do some event-specific tasks, which you'll be trained for separately.st

Either way, as a Code Evangelist, you can use the following as a cheat-sheet of what your number-one priority should be throughout the event:

# Hour-by-Hour

## The Early-Event

- **11am-noon:** [Check-in!](https://clear.codeday.org/dayof) Focus on first-impressions. Make sure students know to be friendly, to meet new people, and to not be competitive with events and by meeting people and asking questions.
- **Noon:** [Kickoff!](https://clear.codeday.org/dayof/deck/slides) Make sure existing teams pitch their ideas and recruit new members, and that shy students speak up (pitch silly ideas). 
- **1-2pmish:** Lunch! Also the [Intro Workshop](https://blog.srnd.org/jumping-over-chairs-and-learning-to-make-a-game-with-construct-2-a796f4def9e9)
- **Until 5pm:** Patrol the venue, talk with groups, and troubleshoot culture problems.

## The Mid-Event

- **5pm:** [Splunk Workshop](https://blog.srnd.org/making-better-games-with-splunk-975cd2a605ce)
- **6pm:** Dinner! Encourage students to meet others by forcing them to leave their computers and eat in the dinner area.
- **7pm-Midnight:** Continue to patrol, checking in with as many students as possible. Identify students who don't seem integrated in the CodeDay culture, and talk with them, or make a note for future activities. Run an activity at some point in this period.

## The Late Event

- **Midnight:** Midnight snack: encourage students to meet others by forcing them to leave their computers. Consider this an "ice cream social."
- **1am-3am:** Patrol, looking for frustrated students. Encourage them to take a break. Run an event at some point, before people are getting too tired. Group activities work better than isolated ones at this time (such as a sing-along).
- **4am-7am:** Patrol, looking for frustrated students, and encouraging them to find a way to stop working on that problem. The odds of the student solving their problem while tired this close to the end of the event are small.

## The End-Game

- **8am:** Breakfast! Start presentation signups. Patrol, looking for teams who seem frustrated, or who haven't signed up, and figure out a way for them to present _something_.
- **9am:** As the judges arrive, explain judging, and give them a judging sheet. In your free time, continue to help teams who are behind so they'll have something to present. Not presenting is the worst outcome for long-term outcomes.
- **10am:** Start presentations. Announce on-deck, and time groups. Time per group should be `60 minutes/number of teams`.
- **11am:** Encourage teams to clean up/pack up. Go with judges, and encourage them to make reasonable choices. Provide feedback about which teams pushed themselves, which were friendly, etc.
- **Noon:** Announce awards (in order of: best game, best app, top overall, special awards). Thank everyone for coming, and briefly describe how they can keep going in their daily life.

# Working with Multiple Evangelists or Staff

When you have multiple Code Evangelists, you should schedule shifts so you have a chance to take a break and, at night, sleep! Make sure as many Code Evangelists as possible are working during busy periods: pre-kickoff, 1-3pm, and dinner.

You can delegate some tasks to non Evangelist-staff, but avoid delegating tasks which require specialized training as much as possible. For example, having staff round-up people for dinner is a good idea, but having them patrolling looking for culture issues is bad.
