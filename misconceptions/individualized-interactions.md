As the event progresses, you'll need to look for ways to encourage attendees to participate in coding on their teams, which means:

1. remembering what they're interested in.
2. identifying points where you can engage those interests.
3. acting on it.

Although this needs to be individualized, here are some common ways to help students:

## Students with direct interest need to be encouraged to expand their community.

It's true for all students, but you'll likely find that the most experienced students are the least likely to leave their friend-groups. Even, paradoxically, if they'd previously met these friends at a CodeDay.

You should ensure experienced groups do not sequester themselves in a meeting room or other nook, heavily encourage participation in community activities, and facilitate introductions during meals for experienced programmers.

## Spend a lot of time talking with students forced to attend as a friend.

We strongly encourage parents not to force their students to attend, but it doesn't matter for some. These students are usually actively looking to _not_ have a good time, so they'll require a little more attention than most.

It's best to assign one team member to get to know these students a little more. Starting near the beginning of the event, the team member should let the students know that we discourage parents from forcing attendance, that they won't be forced to participate, and that we'll have fun non-coding activities as well. They should also ask about the participants' other interests.

Mention, but don't overly encourage participation in relevant workshops. You goal should be to be "on their side," rather than seeming like another parent or teacher who's overly interested in their education.

If/when the team gets bored, send someone to offer a highly-individualized mini-workshop on an intro to coding. If that doesn't work, it's likely anything else you do will cause them to dislike programming even more.

If you're unable to build any interest, it's probably best to call the parents and ask them to pick up their students, letting them know that the website is clear that CodeDay is for students with some interest in attending, not for parents to force attendance.

## Students who want to make art should be encouraged to join beginner teams and to attend the intro workshop.

Because video game art is already a digital medium, and because students interested in video game art often got the interest through an interest in playing video games, it's usually easy to convince art-interested students to attend the intro workshop.

Artists are unlikely to contribute in any technical way to advanced teams, so after the intro workshop, you should encourage any artists who've joined more experienced teams to reconsider joining a beginner team (making a few suggestions if possible).

## Students who want to make sounds, music, or do voice acting will require more encouragement.

For students with interests less related to coding and video games, you can expect less interest in learning to code. We recommend heavy encouragement to join the intro workshop, encouragement to work with beginner teams, and an understanding that more than half of these students will still not pick up coding after your efforts.

Make sure they have a good time, encourage them to come back, and suggest some coding-related projects which relate to their interests which could be pursued with some help in the future.

## Students who don't know why they're there are usually hesitant programmers. Encourage them.

Students who weren't forced to attend, but don't have a specific plan to contribute are usually beginners who are hesitant to admit they're interested in programming (either because of social pressure or because they're afraid they'll fail).

You should heavily encourage these students to attend beginner workshops, regularly check in with the students for mentor needs, and make sure they participate in activities to keep their spirits up.

If you don't do enough to keep these students feeling confident, they'll usually treat CodeDay as a party, playing a lot of video games (at best) or making trouble (at worst).

## Be direct with business students.

Business students joining a team to do business work can make the event seem a lot less fun for the team involved. When you encounter these students, you should make it clear that a business model, pitch deck, and customer development are not part of the judging for CodeDay, and that they should be there with an interest in code.

You can refund the tickets of any students who aren't interested in participating in that way.

Be sure to check in on any teams with business students to make sure they stay focused on fun things, and don't get pulled into discussing target markets or elevator pitches.
