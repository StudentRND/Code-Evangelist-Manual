If you ask a room of 100 random high school students what they think "coding" looks like, a quarter will describe this:

Another quarter will describe this scene from The Social Network:

Most of the remainder will talk about being forced to learn Java (or worse, C++ or LISP) by a teacher or parent, and having had little idea why it was something they'd be seriously interested in pursuing.

# How can we make students want to learn? Help them form hybrid identities.

With such negative expectations, we shouldn't be surprised that offering to teach coding isn't appealing to most students.

At best, programs which try to attack these misconceptions head-on are able to motivate students with extra-credit or promises of high salaries, but it's still a poor strategy which attracts unmotivated students.

CodeDay takes a different approach: we'd rather students attend because they think they'd enjoy attending, which means finding reasons for students to attend other than learning to code.

Especially by high school, most students have a strong sense of who they are, and to what groups they belong. A student might think of himself as an artist, a musician, or a writer.

CodeDay works because we find ways which coding can relate with these existing identities and interests. At the event, you will meet a number of students who have been convinced to attend on this basis, and your job is to help students fully incorporate coding into their existing identity.

# As the event starts, get to know attendees.

To work with students' existing interests, you need to start by knowing each individual student.

As you check in each attendee, ask her what brought her to the event. Here are some particular questions you can ask in just a minute while checking someone in:

- Is this your first time going to something like this?
- What made you register for CodeDay?
- Do you have any ideas you want to make?
- How do you think you'll help out on a team?

If you have multiple check-in staff, you should not only ensure each staff member is asking these questions, but you should also assign any Code Evangelist-trained staff to mingle with already-checked-in attendees (and, if there's a line, in-line attendees) asking the same questions.

When you meet a beginner attendee, probe as far as needed to learn more about their non-coding interests. Based on local promotion, you'll usually meet beginners who fall into a few archetypes:

- Students who are directly interested in programming themelves.
- Students whose parents are forcing them to attend.
- Students who want to contribute to games by making art.
- Students who want to contribute to games by making sound effects, music, or other ways.
- Students who registered for the event because it seems fun, but don't know how they'll contribute.
- Students interested in business or marketing.
 
# Have individualized interactions with students.

As the event progresses, you'll need to look for ways to encourage attendees to participate in coding on their teams, which means:

1. remembering what they're interested in.
2. identifying points where you can engage those interests.
3. acting on it.
