If you ask a room of 100 random high school students what they think "coding" looks like, a quarter will describe this:

Another quarter will describe this scene from The Social Network:

Most of the remainder will talk about being forced to learn Java (or worse, C++ or LISP) by a teacher or parent, and having had little idea why it was something they'd be seriously interested in pursuing.

# How can we make students want to learn? Help them form hybrid identities.

With such negative expectations, we shouldn't be surprised that offering to teach coding isn't appealing to most students.

At best, programs which try to attack these misconceptions head-on are able to motivate students with extra-credit or promises of high salaries, but it's still a poor strategy which attracts unmotivated students.

CodeDay takes a different approach: we'd rather students attend because they think they'd enjoy attending, which means finding reasons for students to attend other than learning to code.

Especially by high school, most students have a strong sense of who they are, and to what groups they belong. A student might think of himself as an artist, a musician, or a writer.

CodeDay works because we find ways which coding can relate with these existing identities and interests. At the event, you will meet a number of students who have been convinced to attend on this basis, and your job is to help students fully incorporate coding into their existing identity.

# As the event starts, get to know attendees.

To work with students' existing interests, you need to start by knowing each individual student.

As you check in each attendee, ask her what brought her to the event. Here are some particular questions you can ask in just a minute while checking someone in:

- Is this your first time going to something like this?
- What made you register for CodeDay?
- Do you have any ideas you want to make?
- How do you think you'll help out on a team?

If you have multiple check-in staff, you should not only ensure each staff member is asking these questions, but you should also assign any Code Evangelist-trained staff to mingle with already-checked-in attendees (and, if there's a line, in-line attendees) asking the same questions.

When you meet a beginner attendee, probe as far as needed to learn more about their non-coding interests. Based on local promotion, you'll usually meet beginners who fall into a few archetypes:

- Students who are directly interested in programming themelves.
- Students whose parents are forcing them to attend.
- Students who want to contribute to games by making art.
- Students who want to contribute to games by making sound effects, music, or other ways.
- Students who registered for the event because it seems fun, but don't know how they'll contribute.
- Students interested in business or marketing.
 
# Have individualized interactions with students.

As the event progresses, you'll need to look for ways to encourage attendees to participate in coding on their teams, which means:

1. remembering what they're interested in.
2. identifying points where you can engage those interests.
3. acting on it.

Although this needs to be individualized, here are some common ways to help students:

## Students with direct interest need to be encouraged to expand their community.

It's true for all students, but you'll likely find that the most experienced students are the least likely to leave their friend-groups. Even, paradoxically, if they'd previously met these friends at a CodeDay.

You should ensure experienced groups do not sequester themselves in a meeting room or other nook, heavily encourage participation in community activities, and facilitate introductions during meals for experienced programmers.

## Spend a lot of time talking with students forced to attend as a friend.

We strongly encourage parents not to force their students to attend, but it doesn't matter for some. These students are usually actively looking to _not_ have a good time, so they'll require a little more attention than most.

It's best to assign one team member to get to know these students a little more. Starting near the beginning of the event, the team member should let the students know that we discourage parents from forcing attendance, that they won't be forced to participate, and that we'll have fun non-coding activities as well. They should also ask about the participants' other interests.

Mention, but don't overly encourage participation in relevant workshops. You goal should be to be "on their side," rather than seeming like another parent or teacher who's overly interested in their education.

If/when the team gets bored, send someone to offer a highly-individualized mini-workshop on an intro to coding. If that doesn't work, it's likely anything else you do will cause them to dislike programming even more.

If you're unable to build any interest, it's probably best to call the parents and ask them to pick up their students, letting them know that the website is clear that CodeDay is for students with some interest in attending, not for parents to force attendance.

## Students who want to make art should be encouraged to join beginner teams and to attend the intro workshop.

Because video game art is already a digital medium, and because students interested in video game art often got the interest through an interest in playing video games, it's usually easy to convince art-interested students to attend the intro workshop.

Artists are unlikely to contribute in any technical way to advanced teams, so after the intro workshop, you should encourage any artists who've joined more experienced teams to reconsider joining a beginner team (making a few suggestions if possible).

## Students who want to make sounds, music, or do voice acting will require more encouragement.

For students with interests less related to coding and video games, you can expect less interest in learning to code. We recommend heavy encouragement to join the intro workshop, encouragement to work with beginner teams, and an understanding that more than half of these students will still not pick up coding after your efforts.

Make sure they have a good time, encourage them to come back, and suggest some coding-related projects which relate to their interests which could be pursued with some help in the future.

## Students who don't know why they're there are usually hesitant programmers. Encourage them.

Students who weren't forced to attend, but don't have a specific plan to contribute are usually beginners who are hesitant to admit they're interested in programming (either because of social pressure or because they're afraid they'll fail).

You should heavily encourage these students to attend beginner workshops, regularly check in with the students for mentor needs, and make sure they participate in activities to keep their spirits up.

If you don't do enough to keep these students feeling confident, they'll usually treat CodeDay as a party, playing a lot of video games (at best) or making trouble (at worst).

## Be direct with business students.

Business students joining a team to do business work can make the event seem a lot less fun for the team involved. When you encounter these students, you should make it clear that a business model, pitch deck, and customer development are not part of the judging for CodeDay, and that they should be there with an interest in code.

You can refund the tickets of any students who aren't interested in participating in that way.

Be sure to check in on any teams with business students to make sure they stay focused on fun things, and don't get pulled into discussing target markets or elevator pitches.
