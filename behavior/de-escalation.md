# Approaching an In-Progress Conflict

If a situation involves harassment, hostility, or intimidation toward a particular community member, our first step
should be to make the person feel safe. Here are some tools you can use to help you:

1. **Move close to the person being harassed.** Our presence alone will usually stop any harassment. If the community
   members perpetrating the harassment immediately leave, starting a conversation can help the target calm down and
   feel safer.
2. **Interrupt the conversation.** Most harassers will pretend to be doing nothing wrong when we approach, but if they
   don't stop, we can interrupt the conversation by introducing ourselves.
3. **Call for more staff.**

# Disciplinary Counseling

The goal of disciplinary counseling is to gather information on what happened, get students to understand why it was
inappropriate, and help them correct their behavior and become more mature.

This does not replace sanctions, like being removed from an event, which are needed for the direct safety of our
community and deter future bad behavior. (In addition to disciplinary counseling, most situations should also be
escalated to our conduct team.) However, discipline can be approached as a way to help students improve.

Students often feel the need to challenge rules and infringe on the rights of others. When we counsel students who have
violated our conduct standards, our goals are to:

- Determine the reasons for misconduct.
- Have them accept responsibility.
- Educate them on the reasons for the conduct standard.
- Bring their behavior into compliance with the standards.
- Help them develop their own values.
- Help them better consider repercussions and make better choices.

## Approach the Student

When we approach students who've violated our standards, it's important to start with an expectation that the student
is reasonable (thus the term "Approach" rather than "Confront"). This is often more true than we'd like to believe
in the heat-of-the-moment, and we are regularly able to change the behavior of previous violators.

It can help to de-escalate further to remember that Code Evangelists are just arbitrators between the official policy
and the student. While we must understand and convey the reasons for the policy, students should understand that
the discussion is not "you vs. them," it's "the conduct standards vs. them."

## Guiding the Conversation

Students don't want to hear a lecture, and it serves little purpose anyway. It's important for us to guide the
conversation, but our ultimate goals are, as above, to understand their motivations, and help them improve in the
future.

Students rarely make conversation about their bad behavior easy. Here are a few techniques to address the usual
responses:

- **Deny they were involved, and challenge you to prove it:** Just walk away and escalate.
- **Accuse you of a personal vendetta:** You do not need to justify yourself. As usual, refuse to discuss further and
  escalate it.
- **Derail the conversation with tangents:** Keep things on-track by refusing to discuss anything but the issue.
- **Rationalization ("special circumstances") or projection ("everyone else does it"):** Remind them that they agreed
  to the conduct standards, they violated the standards
- **Shifting the guilt onto you for doing your job:** Remind them that they agreed to the conduct standards, and that
  you are only an arbitrator between the student and the conduct standards.
- **Admit guilt and apologize:** This is the tricky one, because it's kinda the result we'd like, however if you're
  overly lenient, other students may get the impression that they can get away with anything by apologizing.

Older students, and students who commit more serious violations are less likely to take responsibility. If the
conversation is not productive, or if the student becomes abusive, you should end it and escalate (if you haven't yet).
