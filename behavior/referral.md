The purpose of your enforcement role is to keep people safe, comfortable, and happy, and to resolve incidents as
quickly as possible.

You are the best person at the event to de-escalate conflicts, and counsel students to prevent minor violations, but
we do not expect you to have an answer to everything, and we don't want to make you into the "bad guy" whenever
something comes up.

When something happens which requires punishment, or if you're not immediately sure how to respond, you should not
handle it yourself. Escalate it to the Conduct team by calling (855) 556-7763, and choosing option 1. In most cases
we can talk to the involved students directly.
