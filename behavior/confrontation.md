If a situation involves harassment, hostility, or intimidation toward a particular community member, our first step
should be to make the person feel safe. Here are some tools you can use to help you:

1. **Move close to the person being harassed.** Our presence alone will usually stop any harassment. If the community
   members perpetrating the harassment immediately leave, starting a conversation can help the target calm down and
   feel safer.
2. **Interrupt the conversation.** Most harassers will pretend to be doing nothing wrong when we approach, but if they
   don't stop, we can interrupt the conversation by introducing ourselves.
3. **Call for more staff.**
