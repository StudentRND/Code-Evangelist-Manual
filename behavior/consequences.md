The purpose of the enforcement role is to keep people safe, comfortable, and happy, and to resolve incidents as
quickly as possible. We are the best people at the event to de-escalate conflicts, and counsel students to prevent
minor violations.

For less-serious incidents, we can usually achieve a promise to stop the offending behavior through disciplinary
counseling, and we can ensure this promise is kept by following up with the students throughout the event.

**It's very important that you report all incidents to the Conduct team, even if you pursue no action, in case a parent
or teacher contacts SRND later.** You can submit non-priority incidents by email at conduct@srnd.org (or use the phone
number below). You should include as much detail as possible.

# Escalation to Conduct Team

Whenever an incident involves harassment, offensive or sexualized language or imagery, safety, or illegal activity,
you should escalate it to the Conduct team. We are obligated to follow certain procedures per agreements with our
school and university partners, and we don't expect Code Evangelists to know the exact thing to do.

You can react Conduct on the security/emergency hotline, 844-864-8443.
