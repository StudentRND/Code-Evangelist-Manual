Unfortunately, attendees sometimes make bad choices (especially younger attendees). When these choices prevent others
from enjoying themselves or endanger the safety of the event, it's our job as Code Evangelists to intervene.

When we do, our goal is to get things back on track as quickly as possible. That means we:

1. Assess the situation.
2. Confront the community members involved.
3. Find out what happened.
4. Decide on a response (counseling and/or a referral).
5. Follow-up.

# Enforcing the Rules is a Responsibility

At SRND events, students are subject to the [Code of Conduct and Community Standards.](https://conduct.srnd.org/) You
should make a point to familiarize yourself, but never let the lack of a rule prevent you from standing up for what's
right.

Likewise, it's important that we apply the rules equally to everyone, even if they're a critical member of the event
staff, a $5,000 sponsor, or a VIP.

# Don't Rush In

Every situation is different. When we see something wrong, we often want to intervene right away, but this rarely leads
to the best outcome. Taking 30 seconds to consider the unique situation will help you make the best decisions.

- **Decide if it's safe.** If not, call 911 immediately.
- **Calm down.** You're likely stressed, even if you don't notice it. Take a few breaths and un-tense your muscles.
- **Consider your relationship to those involved.** You may need a different approach if you're talking to a stranger,
  a long-time community-member, or a friend.
- **Identify your assumptions.** We rarely understand the entire situation. When you talk with the students, it's
  important that you're thorough in your fact-gathering.
- **Identify your biases.** We should aim to treat everyone fairly -- on the basis of their behavior -- but that's not
  always simple. (For example, when students have been caught kissing, staff have often been more harsh to the women
  than the men.)
