Many see meeting new people as a high-risk activity and prefer to avoid it. For students who feel like outsiders in the
coding community, this is doubly true. But for students to successfully pursue coding in the long-term, they'll need
the support and encouragement of their peers, so it's extremely important that we encourage socialization.

To reduce the discomfort for new community members, we can make it extremely clear that being social is an expected
part of our events.


# Embrace the Awkwardness

When we're working as Code Evangelists, it's important to remember that we're playing a role. Things we might find
uncomfortable, like introducing ourselves to a closed group of friends, or being unwaveringly enthusiastic, are part
of our stage personality.

Being extraordinarily social requires more energy than you're used to putting in day-to-day, but being extraordinarily
social is worth the effort, because people are used to the ordinary. It also feels awkward, but our stage personality
can embrace that awkwardness.

Enthusiasm and friendliness are contagious -- it's hard not to get excited when you talk to someone who's excited and,
moreover, we make it feel awkward to _not_ match our level of enthusiasm.


# Setup

The layout of a venue can have a big effect on how social students are.

At coding events like CodeDay, teams love using conference rooms as private workspaces, but this leads them to isolate
themselves and creates a clique-y atmosphere during group events. If there's enough communal space, blocking-off these
rooms helps us keep everyone as part of one group.

At the same time, having too many people in one space can be overwhelming. Somewhere between 40-120 people seems to be
optimal for encouraging socialization. At larger venues, with larger teams, splitting teams between large communal
rooms may actually increase networking.

Putting drinks and food inconveniently far from participants, in a hang-out-friendly area of the venue, is also a great
way to encourage meeting new students, as is requiring students to eat in a communal space rather than their
workstations.


# Introductions

As people are walking in the door, we can make their first introduction a social one. If you're running check-in,
slowing down the line a bit to ask questions can be a positive -- if not, standing at the door is helpful. If you have
access to volunteers (or long-term community members), a helpful way to increase the amount of socialization is to host
a competition to see who can introduce themselves to the largest number of people.

Here are some particular questions you can ask in just a minute to someone you've never met.

- Is this your first time going to something like this?
- What made you register for CodeDay?
- Do you have any ideas you want to make?
- How do you think you'll help out on a team?

As we meet students, we'll usually find many students who share similar interests who don't already know each other.
Introducing these students to each other is a great way to make it clear that this is a behavior which is encouraged.


# Icebreakers

Everyone hates icebreakers, but the research shows that they work well. (Maybe just because we bond over our shared
hatred of being forced to do an icebreaker!) Icebreakers are a particularly valuable part of our toolkit because they're
done at the beginning of an event, when people are still unsure what the culture is, so doing one is important.

- Host socially-focused tournaments. Attendees often see these sort of icebreakers as more fun, since they're not
  explicitly about meeting others. A common go-to is Rock-Paper-Scissors. Attendees pick a random other attendee to
  play, and then the loser follows the winner. These groups of followers continue to build, until we end up with a
  final showdown between the two longest-running winners.
- Number nametags with a random number from 1-5 as attendees pick them up. Host an activity later requiring attendees
  to meet up with their number-groups.
