  - **Greet each participant as they come in the door. Ask them about themselves.**
  - If you have a larger staff, have an internal contest to see who can talk to the most people before the kickoff.
  - Ask students directly how you can help them have a fun event.
  - Talk about what areas of code you struggle with when asking students about their goals.
  - **Host a group tournament before things get started, such as Rock-Paper-Scissors.**
  - Encourage all groups to get meals at the same time. Allow lines to form, and encourage talking in the lines.
  - Make the midnight snack an "ice cream social" and require no coding for 15 minutes to get the snack.
  - Number nametags with a random number from 1-5 as attendees pick them up. Host an activity later requiring attendees to meet up with their number-groups.


  - **Require all pre-formed teams to pitch their ideas, and allow new members to join those teams.** Let them know before the pitches.
  - Remind teams which seem focused on making a polished product that it's the least important judging criteria when patrolling.
  - Don't allow teams to present pitch decks.
  - Ensure mentors are briefed on the importance of fun.
