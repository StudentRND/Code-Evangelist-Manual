# How Culture is Actually Formed

When you hear "company culture", do you think ping-pong tables and

might have had a little too much of the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid. The real culture of an organization comprises:

- What's expected and who gets rewarded.
- How decisions are made.

Free snacks and game areas are just one small expression of a much larger culture (one that means "you're expected to
spend a lot of time at this office.")

Our cultural values translate to:

- **What's expected and who gets rewarded:**
  - People are expected to be friendly and meet new people.
  - People who make something fun and try something new are rewarded.
- **How decisions are made:**
  - (Almost) anything that's fun is allowed.

## Ice Cream

Pretend I ask you, "do you want ice cream?" Almost all reasonable people will say yes. Yet thousands of ice cream shops
go out of business in the US each year. That's because what people say they want and what people actually want are very
different.

A lot of building culture fits into this pattern. If you simply ask an attendee to take a break, participate in an
activity, or meet new people, they'll usually say they don't want to.

Much of our job, therefore, is finding as many ways to encourage students to participate as possible.
