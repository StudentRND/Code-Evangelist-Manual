As most professionals have learned, there really isn't such a thing as "coding," there's just "debugging" and "bugging."
And debugging isn't really fun.

Beginners, who often have a wildly-inaccurate picture of how the computer is executing their code, usually spend almost
all their time debugging. Making progress is what makes it all worthwhile, and because they don't make much of that,
the morale of beginners can get so low that they quit.

Activities allow attendees to take their mind off their problems for a bit. This has the effect of increasing their
happiness, and increasing the probability of actually solving their problem. (That said, the attendees who can most
benefit usually require the most convincing. Review the earlier section on Ice Cream questions.)

Activities should be used sparingly, and should be kept somewhat brief -- 15-30 minutes for activities in the main room
(which are distracting to those not participating), and an hour for those which happen elsewhere.



# Low-Energy

Most participants in these activities are seated. They tend to be better at building the event culture, but they don't
work as when participants are tired.


## Lightning Talks

Run as a workshop, participants are given the opportunity to give a four-minute talk about anything which is
interesting to them. In the past, we've seen talks about everything from lock-picking to a history of blue backgrounds.

This workshop sometimes works _really well_ and sometimes works _really poorly,_ so your mileage may vary. It will
likely require some convincing, either way.


## Slideshare Improv

Have you ever watched a technical talk and thought, "this is absolute gibberish?" It probably is, but with this
activity, it's guaranteed. Here's how it works:

1. One or two "presenters" stand in front of a projection screen \(or TV\), facing the audience. They shouldn't be able
   to see what's on the screen behind them.
2. Open one of the many online slide deck repositories on the projector, and pick a random category.
3. Slowly hover your mouse over the available slide decks. The audience should cheer for the decks they think would be
   most funny.
4. Open the best deck, and give the presenters a clicker \(or mouse, or whatever else you have to advance the slides\).
5. After a count-down, the presenters should turn around to see their slide deck, and then immediately start trying to
   present.  Start a timer for three minutes. 

There are generally no winners for slideshare improv, but if you'd like to give out a prize or award, you can hold an
applause poll after everyone has presented. \(The presenter with the loudest cheer is the winner.\)

Despite the fact that it's named "slideshare improv", you have a few options for where to find slide decks:

## Drawing Contest

Assign a subject and give attendees five minutes to draw their best impression, then have everyone present their
drawings. Other attendees or volunteers can be the judges.

You can use the [random noun generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/noun.php) to come up with a subject, which will
usually be stranger than anything you can come up with. Abstract subjects are usually more interesting.




# High-Energy

Most participants in these activities are active, so they're great if you need to get the group's energy up. That said,
they usually don't help as much in building up the event culture.

## Karaoke/Sing-Along

## Cup Stacking

## No-Hands Fizz-Buzz

Attendees race to be the first to write a working program for a small prize, but aren't allowed to use their hands.
Usually, only about 4-5 students will sign up to participate, but it's hilarious for everyone watching.

Traditionally, we've asked students to write a FizzBuzz program.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
> and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

For beginner-heavy events, you may want to try having them write a program to print "hello world," or even making a
simple Construct game.

## Walk

A group of people walks to a nearby convenience store, landmark, etc late at night.

All minors should sign out and in, at least two volunteers should go (one at the back, and one at the front). Regular
counts should be made to ensure no one was lost, particularly after the group pauses, or leaves a store.
