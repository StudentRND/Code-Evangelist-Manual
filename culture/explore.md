Especially by high school, most students have a strong sense of who they are, and to what groups they belong. A student
might think of himself as an artist, a musician, or a writer.

Our goal as Code Evangelists is to find ways we can relate with these existing identities and interests. To do that,
we need to get to know each student individually. We can use this information to find subtle ways to encourage them
to explore coding, in a way that individually excites them.

# Push, Not Pull

Getting to know a student requires, well, talking to them. (And, more specifically, asking questions!) To be effective,
we need to get to know every student at the event: a daunting task which will take a little bit of strategy.

Students, generally, will not start conversations with us. It's very important that we're intentional about seeking
out each student and starting a conversation. To use a technical metaphor, this is a push, rather than a pull, model.

If you walk up to someone and have literally no idea what to say, you can use the same few we list in the "Friendly"
section:

- Is this your first time going to something like this?
- What made you register for CodeDay?
- Do you have any ideas you want to make?
- How do you think you'll help out on a team?

Like with being friendly and enthusiastic, this feels, at times, awkward, but it's best to embrace the awkward, and
ask questions anyway.


# More than Just Facts

Our goal is to gain useful information about the students at our events, not just rote facts. What's the difference?

- **Fact:** Fedor is majoring in Computer Science.
- **Fact/Insight:** Fedor is majoring in Computer Science because he believes in using technology to solve the world's
  problems, something he is passionate about.

How do we go from fact to insight? A simple technique we can use is to ask "why" until we feel like we understand. This
technique, called "5 Whys," was originally developed by Toyota, who realized that asking "why" five times usually
led to a deep understanding of manufacturing problems.

Here's an example of how asking "why" a few times might help us understand more about someone:

- _What made you come to CodeDay?_
- My dad told me to go.
- _Why do you think he did that?_
- Well, I guess he thinks I should get into coding.
- _Why?_
- Well, I'm pretty into video gaming I guess. And I've made some pretty cool things with Redstone in Minecraft...

Five "why"s might often be excessive, but asking even a few times can help us go from a simple fact, to an insight we
can use to guide the community member to an appropriate project, and more information which might lead to a better
relationship between us ("I used to play Minecraft a lot too. What sort of things have you made?").


# Removing Barriers to Explore

As the event progresses, you'll need to look for ways to encourage attendees to participate in coding on their teams,
which means:

1. remembering what insights you've learned.
2. identifying points where you can engage with your knowledge.
3. acting on it.

Although this needs to be individualized, here are some common ways to help students:

## Students with direct interest need to be encouraged to expand their community and interests.

It's true for all students, but you'll likely find that the most experienced students are the least likely to leave
their friend-groups. Even, paradoxically, if they'd previously met these friends at a CodeDay.

You should ensure experienced groups do not sequester themselves in a meeting room or other nook, heavily encourage
participation in community activities, and facilitate introductions during meals for experienced programmers.

## Spend a lot of time talking with students forced to attend as a friend.

We strongly encourage parents not to force their students to attend, but it doesn't matter for some. These students are
usually actively looking to _not_ have a good time, so they'll require a little more attention than most.

It's best to assign one team member to specifically get to know these students. Starting near the beginning of the
event, the team member should let the students know that we discourage parents from forcing attendance, that they won't
be forced to participate, and that we'll have fun non-coding activities as well.

They should also ask about the participants' other interests, and try to collect other insights. Often, we can find a
way to drive some interest in coding based. You might be able to relate what you've learned into a customized mini-intro
workshop, or another volunteer might be able to run an impromptu workshop on a relevant topic of interest as it relates
to coding.

If you're unable to build any interest, it's probably best to call the parents and ask them to pick up their students,
letting them know that the website is clear that CodeDay is for students with some interest in attending, not for
parents to force attendance.

## Students who want to make art should be encouraged to join beginner teams and to attend the intro workshop.

Because video game art is already a digital medium, and because students interested in video game art often got the
interest through an interest in playing video games, it's usually easy to convince art-interested students to attend the
intro workshop.

Artists are unlikely to contribute in any technical way to advanced teams, so after the intro workshop, you should
encourage any artists who've joined more experienced teams to reconsider joining a beginner team (making a few
suggestions if possible).

It's usually important that we try to avoid the word "coding" when talking with artists, because artists don't want to
"code," they want to "make video games." (Even though they're the same thing.)

## Students who want to make sounds, music, or do voice acting will require more encouragement.

For students with interests less related to coding and video games, you can expect less interest in learning to code.
We recommend heavy encouragement to join the intro workshop, encouragement to work with beginner teams, and an
understanding that more than half of these students will still not pick up coding after your efforts.

Like with artists, it's useful to encourage the thinking that they would be "making a video game," not "coding."

Make sure they have a good time, encourage them to come back, and suggest some coding-related projects which relate to
their interests which could be pursued with some help in the future.

## Students who don't know why they're there are usually hesitant programmers. Encourage them.

Students who weren't forced to attend, but don't have a specific plan to contribute are usually beginners who are
hesitant to admit they're interested in programming (either because of social pressure or because they're afraid they'll
fail).

You should heavily encourage these students to attend beginner workshops, regularly check in with the students for
mentor needs, and make sure they participate in activities to keep their spirits up.

If you don't do enough to keep these students feeling confident, they'll usually treat CodeDay as a party, playing a
lot of video games (at best) or making trouble (at worst).

## Be direct with business students.

Business students joining a team to do business work can make the event seem a lot less fun for the team involved. When
you encounter these students, you should make it clear that a business model, pitch deck, and customer development are
not part of the judging for CodeDay, and that they should be there with an interest in code.

You can refund the tickets of any students who aren't interested in participating in that way.

Be sure to check in on any teams with business students to make sure they stay focused on fun things, and don't get
pulled into discussing target markets or elevator pitches.
