When you hear "company culture", do you think ping-pong tables and [free Odwalla?](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/mourn-the-loss-of-odwalla-mourn-the-loss-of-your-job/) If so, you might have had a little too much of the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid. The real culture of an organization comprises:

- What's expected of individuals.
- How decisions are made.
- Who gets rewarded, and who gets punished.

Free snacks and game areas are just one small expression of a much larger culture. In the case of the stereotypical ping-pong-table startup, the culture often involves an expectation of lots of work, informal communication and decision hierarchies, and rewarding the loudest and most visible team members with more responsibilities. The free snacks and games are only an indication of the expectation that you'll spend a lot of time in the office talking with co-workers.

CodeDay is no different, but getting our culture right is essential to having a successful event. Let's briefly look at what that culture is:

- **What's expected of individuals:**
  - Be friendly and supportive. Meet people.
  - Have fun.
  - Don't be very competitive.
- **How decisions are made:**
  - Students can make decisions, we're not teachers.
  - Evangelists will promote any good idea, we're not bureaucratic.
  - You don't need permission to do anything (non-disruptive, and within the Code of Conduct)
- **Who gets rewarded, and who gets punished:**
  - People who love code, and make something which shows they care about learning and exploring win.
  - People who try to show off don't get anything.
  
# Students understand the culture though thousands of tiny interactions, but the early ones matter the most.
  
As you go through CodeDay, you should think about which actions you can take to help define the culture. Here are a few examples of actions you can do. The bold ones are strongly encouraged, but we don't expect you to memorize the entire list -- look for ways to express our culture in your own way.

- Be friendly and supportive. Meet people:
  - **Greet each participant as they come in the door. Ask them about themselves.**
  - If you have a larger staff, have an internal contest to see who can talk to the most people before the kickoff.
  - Ask students directly how you can help them have a fun event.
  - Talk about what areas of code you struggle with when asking students about their goals.
  - **Host a group tournament before things get started, such as Rock-Paper-Scissors.**
  - Encourage all groups to get meals at the same time. Allow lines to form, and encourage talking in the lines.
  - Make the midnight snack an "ice cream social" and require no coding for 15 minutes to get the snack.
  
  - Talk about what areas of code you struggle with when asking students about their goals.
- Have fun:
  - Make a fun nametag, and encourage attendees to do the same.
  - Have unusual contests, like the no-hands programming contest.
