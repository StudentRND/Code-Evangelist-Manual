When you hear "company culture", do you think ping-pong tables and [free Odwalla?](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/mourn-the-loss-of-odwalla-mourn-the-loss-of-your-job/) If so, you might have had a little too much of the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid. The real culture of an organization comprises:

- What's expected of individuals.
- How decisions are made.
- Who gets rewarded, and who gets punished.

Free snacks and game areas are just one small expression of a much larger culture. In the case of the stereotypical ping-pong-table startup, the culture often involves an expectation of lots of work, informal communication and decision hierarchies, and rewarding the loudest and most visible team members with more responsibilities. The free snacks and games are only an indication of the expectation that you'll spend a lot of time in the office talking with co-workers.

CodeDay is no different, but getting our culture right is essential to having a successful event. Let's briefly look at what that culture is:

- **What's expected of individuals:**
  - Be nice.
  - Meet people, don't sequester yourself.
  - Don't be very competitive.
- **How decisions are made:**
  - Students can make decisions, we're not teachers.
  - Evangelists will promote any good idea, we're not bureaucratic.
  - You don't need permission to do anything (non-disruptive, and within the Code of Conduct)
- **Who gets rewarded, and who gets punished:**
  - 
  - Evangelists will promote any good idea, we're not super set in our ways
